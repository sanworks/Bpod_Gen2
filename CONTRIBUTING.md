# Contributing

Thank you for considering a contribution to the Bpod project!

# How to contribute
1. Make a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) of the [develop branch](https://github.com/sanworks/Bpod_Gen2/tree/develop) of Bpod_Gen2.
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your fork to create a local copy of it on your machine.
3. Make any updates or additions to the code, and [commit](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits) the changes to your fork.
4. [Push](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) your updated local fork to its remote location on Github.
5. Create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for us to integrate your changes into the project.

# Style Guidelines
Bpod_Gen2 aspires to comply with best practices as specified in Richard Johnson's [MATLAB Style Guidelines 2.0](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46056-matlab-style-guidelines-2-0). We recognize that neuroscience researchers are often beyond busy with research, and we do not want contributions to our tools be hindered in any way. If you are time constrained, please ensure that your contributed code works as intended, and we will make any necessary style edits on our part before the next stable release.

- Note: If you have access to OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 or equivalent, much of the heavy lifting for style compliance can be achieved with the prompt: ```Please format the following MATLAB code to comply with with Richard Johnson's MATLAB Style Guidelines 2.0:```, followed by your code. The output must be validated, keeping in mind that large language models occasionally hallucinate. Also, any formatting of user-facing function names, method names or property names must be reverted or handled to preserve backwards compatibility with existing behavior protocol code.

# Important Notes About Contributing
- We request that all contributions comply with the terms specified in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in this folder.

- The master branch of Bpod_Gen2 contains the latest stable release. We kindly request that you submit your pull request against the 'develop' branch of Bpod_Gen2, so that we can test the code before it is added to the default software for everyone. Pull requests made against 'master' will be closed, with a request to resubmit against 'develop'. Thank you!

- We deeply appreciate the time and effort you have invested in your contribution! Please take a moment to reach out to us at admin@sanworks.io, so that our core dev team can personally thank you for being a contributing member of the Bpod community!
